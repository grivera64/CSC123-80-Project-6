This project is composed of 3 main programs.

## Main Programs
1. Vehicle Simulation (simulation/VehicleClient.java)
2. Lambda Expression (lambda/TestMYF.java)
3. Amusement Park Simulation (park/SimulatePark.java)

## Purpose

- Vehicle Simulation: Represents the storing and comparison of different vehicle types (Bicycles and Motorized Vehicles)

- Lambda Expression: Tests using Lambda Expressions by Incrementing a number by five

- Amusement Park Simulation: Represents the management of moving parts of an Amusement Park

## How to run
